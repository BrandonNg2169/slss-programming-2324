# Headings 
to create headings we use hash symbols (#)
We can also create different "level headings 
To create subheadings we use multiple hashes

##  This is a subheading level 2 
### this is a level 3 subheading 
###### this is 6 

# Modifying Text Style 
We can use asterisks to modify text style, specifically bold and italics 
i want this **word** to be bold with **
*word* to be italicized *word*
***i want it to be both***

**# Link Links allow us to reference information externally [A tool **YOU** might use](https://chat.openai.com) Exercise: * if you have an open ai account * ask chatgpt to make you two links to whatever website using markdown * at the end of the links, put down "from chatgpt" * if you don't * create two more links to some other website you think is useful**

#BLOCKQUOTES
BLOCK QUTOES ALLOWS us to emphasize a bigger chunk of text 
We use carets(>)to create blockquotes 
>this is an example
>This is line two of blockquotes
.
>this is line four of the blockqutoes


# List 
We can create both _unordered_ and _ordered_ list
We can use a sub portion of the list by list by placing **TABS


# Ordered list
if there is a specific order to the element in our list 








# Tables 
We can organize information in tables using maekdown.
We use dashes (-) and pipes (|)

eg 

| Name    | Age    | Sign    
|---          |---       |---
|Joe    |35     |
